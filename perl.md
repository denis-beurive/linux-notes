# Perl One liner

## Read input and execute arbitrary code on the whole input

Use the option "`-e`":

```bash
cat /etc/hosts | perl -e '@v=(); while(<>) {chomp; @t=split(/\s+/, $_); push @v, $t[0]} print join(", ", @v)'
```

## Read input line by line and execute arbitrary code on each line

Use the option "`-ne`":

```bash
cat /etc/hosts | perl -ne 'chomp; @t=split(/\s+/, $_); print $t[0] . "\n"'
```

> The content of each line is given by the value of `$_`.

## Read input line by line and perform replacements on each line

Use the option "`-pe`":

```bash
cat /etc/hosts | perl -pe 's/^[^\s]+//'
```

> The option "`-pe`" is designed to be used for _replacements only_.
